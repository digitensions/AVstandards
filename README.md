# AVstandards
Collaborative collection of available audiovisual file standards or supporting documents. Please feel free to contribute anything useful for audiovisual and digital preservation.

# Naming convention for PDFs or files
There's no defined style as yet, but ask that you rename the asset you upload to lead with the audiovisual file type. This makes it easier to find what you're looking for. Open to suggestions for naming conventions if anyone likes.
